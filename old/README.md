Offers suomi.fi-styleguide icons as React-components. **This library does not take responsibility of accessibility, component passes given attributes to the SVG-element.**

This repository uses semantic versioning (https://semver.org/), but since it doesn't contain an distinct API of its own, the following rules for versioning are applied:

- **Major**: Changes that result in visible changes in the existing icons or other major changes that affect the way the icons are used from the library.
- **Minor**: Addition of new icons, or non-breaking changes to the inner structure or build configuration
- **Patch**: Any other changes that don't affect the build

```bash
yarn add suomifi-icons
